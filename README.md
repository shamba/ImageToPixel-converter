Information
======================

This project contains a simple Interface which converts any image in any format to grayscale pixel values.
Pixels values will be stored in a text file in the same directory as the image file.


The grayscale value of a pixel is a mean of the three values (R,G,B). 
Mathematically, Grayscale = R x 0.7+G x 0.2+B x 0.1
